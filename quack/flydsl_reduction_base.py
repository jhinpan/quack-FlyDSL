"""FlyDSL sibling of :mod:`quack.reduction_base`.

Same job as the CuTe base -- pick a thread geometry for one row and describe the
tile it covers -- but host-side only. The CuTe base also hands the kernel a
``TiledCopy`` and the shared buffer it reduces through; here the kernel builds
both, from the numbers computed here, for two reasons:

* a FlyDSL ``TiledCopy`` is a bundle of MLIR values, so it cannot be built
  outside the trace and passed in;
* FlyDSL keys a compiled artifact on the kernel's source plus the *scalar*
  closure values it can see, and it cannot see through an object reference, so
  anything the kernel body specializes on has to reach it as a plain value
  rather than as ``self``. Two feature sets would otherwise share a kernel.

The cluster tier is dropped throughout: CDNA has no distributed shared memory to
split a row across CTAs.
