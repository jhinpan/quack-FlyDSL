"""Generic host plumbing shared by every FlyDSL kernel: arch validation, launch
dispatch, stream and dtype translation, ROCm buffer-descriptor row rules.

A ``Launcher`` holds one artifact and keys nothing itself, so **the caller must
key its launchers by device** as well as by specialization. FlyDSL keys
artifacts on the JitFunction by argument signature alone, so a launcher shared
across GPUs hands the second one a module loaded into the first one's context:
hipErrorInvalidDevice. FlyDSL's own on-disk cache under ``~/.flydsl/cache``
sits below both.

A sibling of :mod:`quack.cache.jit`, not a reuse: that module's disk half is
CuTe-specific (``.o`` export plus tvm_ffi ``load_module``) and imports cutlass,
so it will not load on ROCm.
